# Monitoring HTTP Compression

This document shows how to use one of the bash tools (`http_compression_stats.bash`)  to measure the effects of [HTTP compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_compression). The tool is essentially a wrapper around the `curl` command-line tool, which supports compression out-of-the-box.
